# Printer Management
### DESKTOP project for CDEEE IT to facilitate IP access of printers in the company

The project arose from the need in the help desk department of the CDEEE (of which I was a member at the time of making this app), to be able to verify the printers without having to write the ip, in order to provide a better service to the users.

This would be officially my first "WEB application", with this I acquired the knowledge of managing the DOM, working with CSS, Nodejs, Deploy a WEB application, working with SASS and some other FRONT-END concepts.


Design framework used:
